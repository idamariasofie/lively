        We transform lives for a living… every single day. We do this by
        offering plant-based recipes, meal plans, cookbooks, and experiences
        that teach determined people like you how to fuel your passion. We’re
        a “for-profit company” that also creates an enormous amount of
        life-changing resources free of charge. It’s an honor to guide and
        support your wellness journey!</br></br>
        I started blending a daily smoothie with spinach (aka: a green smoothie) for my family, wondering if the health claims
        were legit. I quickly noticed I had more energy and didn’t need so much coffee. I was also staying full and using them
        as meals. Even the kids enjoyed them… and never seemed to get sick.</br></br>
        
        For my family, green smoothies were the “gateway drug” to a healthier life. Within a few weeks of drinking them, I was a
        different person. I was actually eager to wake up in the morning, bike my son to preschool, and then head to the
        playground with my daughter.
