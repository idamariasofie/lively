## [Overview](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#overview)


# [Lively](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively)

Lively is a healthy lifestyle blog that invites users to:

- Get inspired by daily blog posts to add healthy habits to their lives.
- Browse and filter recipes for breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner, etc.
- Create their own profiles.
- Like and interact with blog posts.

Lively is accessible via all browsers with full responsiveness on different screen sizes. Its aim is to create a safe, informed community of users looking to improve their lives with exercise, meditation, and nutritious food. This site has been created to meet the needs of adding healthy habits to your everyday life in an easy way. Visit the blog and get inspired by the daily posts, or explore the recipe page to filter and browse through all the recipes.

In future development, the project aims to offer users an upgraded premium system with payment options for weekly meal planning sent customized based on their profiles and preferences. Users will also be able to save and add recipes, training guides, etc., to their profile for easy access to their favorites.

# [UX - User Experience](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#ux---user-experience)

## [Design Inspiration](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#design-inspiration)

I wanted Lively to have a warm yet clean aesthetic feeling with colorful food photography, clean magazine-like typography, and design. This approach allows photos to stand out with their beautiful colors.

### [Color Scheme](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#color-scheme)

Due to the large hero sections with colorful photography, the overall design is clean yet elegant. Here is the color scheme:

[![colors](assets/readme/screenshots/colors.png)]

### [Fonts](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#fonts)

Using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I imported 'Baskerville' and 'Lora'. Baskerville, a classic serif font, gives the website a clean look, resembling printed magazines, while Lora has a modern vibe that works well for longer texts.

### [Imagery](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#imagery)

All the imagery has been carefully selected to align with the overall feeling of Lively and the website. The remaining imagery will be uploaded by the author to the database.

# [Project Planning](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#project-planning)

The project goal was to build a simple blog to promote a healthier everyday life, with a focus on lifestyle, recipes, exercises, and meditation guides.

## [Site Goals](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#site-goals)

- Provide users with a good experience.
- Create a visually pleasing and intuitive website.
- Ensure easy navigation and fulfillment of feature CRUD functionalities.
- Maintain consistent UX across different devices.
- Allow scalability for future additions.

## [Agile Methodologies - Project Management](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#agile-methodologies---project-management)

Lively follows Agile planning methods, using the [Github Projects Board](https://github.com/users/idamariasofie/projects/3/views/1?filterQuery=) to plan and document all work.

### [MoSCoW Prioritization](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#moscow-prioritization)

- **Must Haves:** Critical components for the project, reaching MVP.
- **Should Haves:** Valuable components not vital at the MVP stage.
- **Could Haves:** Nice-to-have features if time allows.
- **Won't Haves:** Features of low priority or no longer fitting the project's brief.

### [Sprints](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#sprints)

Sprints were planned to achieve the MVP a month before the submission date of March 4, 2024.

![Sprint Timetable](assets/readme/screenshots/sprint.png)

# [User Stories](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#user-stories)

User stories and features are managed on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/idamariasofie/projects/3/views/1?filterQuery=).

## [Lively User Stories](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#visitor-user-stories)

Visitor user story

Recipes

![Profileuserstory](assets/readme/screenshots/recipes-user.png)

# [Scope Plan](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#scope-plane)

To manage project scope effectively, essential features were identified early on, including:

- Accessible, easy-to-navigate website.
- Responsive design for various devices.
- User Authentication and Profile creation/editing.
- Recipe page with filter function.
- Commenting on posts after authentication.
- Business details for user information.

Planning allowed for a balance between feasibility and satisfaction of assessment criteria.

# [Skeleton & Surface Plan](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#skeleton--surface-planes)

## [Wireframes](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#wireframes)

### Home Page Wireframes

![homewireframe](assets/readme/screenshots/wireframe-home.png)
![homewireframe2](assets/readme/screenshots/wireframe-home-2.png)
![footerwireframe](assets/readme/screenshots/wireframe-footer.png)

Wireframes for the login/logout, sign up, and contact us pages maintain a similar design for consistency throughout the website.

Sign Up Wireframe

![signupwireframe](assets/readme/screenshots/wireframe-signup.png)

## [Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#database-schema---entity-relationship-diagram)

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Lively, displaying relationships between feature components within the database

![erd](assets/readme/screenshots/erd.png)

This ERD demonstrates how each feature interacts with each other and the connected PostgreSQL Database. Using Django's User Model, and Django AllAuth to carry out the user authentication. A user_id is created when the user registers with their username and email. 
This allows the user to access and edit their profile, bio, image etc and add comments, when logged in. For future development, a weekly meal plan could be added and saved recipes, that could be accessed from the profile. 

The Profile, Recipes and Comments Models were inspired by the blog walkthrough by the Code Institute and the [Smoothies App by Soukaina Samadi](https://github.com/soukasamadi/Smoothies-blog?tab=readme-ov-file). 
They helped me to get a good and secure grasp of the templating structure and connected Python files to push my features further, adjusting them to suit my project. 

Through the Admin Django Dashboard, the connected user_id to all data entered to the site means that the Admin can remove a User and their data completely through the additon of on_delete=models.CASCADE. 
A user can delete their profile, but they can not delete the comments they have posted, this feature will come in the next version.

# [Security](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#security)

A number of security steps were taken in this project to protect the user's submitted data. To meet the strict internet standards of protecting a user's data, the following processes were included in the project's development.

**AllAuth**

Django AllAuth is an installable framework that takes care of the user registration and authentication process. Authentication was needed to determine when a user was registered or unregistered, and it controlled what content was accessible on Lively. The setup of AllAuth included:

- Installing it in my workspace dependencies.
- Adding it to my INSTALLED_APPS in my settings.py.
- Sourcing the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS from the AllAuth docs for my settings.py.
- Adding its URL to my project's 'urls.py'.
- Running database migrations to create the tables needed for AllAuth.

**Defensive Design**

Lively was developed to ensure a good user experience, to the best of my current learning experience with Django.

- Input validation and error messages provide feedback to the user to guide them towards the desired outcome.
- Unregistered users are diverted to the Sign Up page from restricted access pages.
- Authentication processes control edit/delete icons to reveal them to the content author only.
- Deletion of a profile is confirmed through an additional page, double-checking with the user.
- Error pages are displayed with 'Home' buttons to help users get back on track.
- Testing and validation of features complete the process.

**CSRF Tokens**

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form to help authenticate the request with the server when the form is submitted. Absence of these tokens can leave a site vulnerable to attackers who may steal a user's data.

# [Features](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#features)

## [User View - Registered/Unregistered](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#user-view---registeredunregistered)

The idea behind Lively is to make healthy recipes accessible to all who want to live a healthier life. Therefore, I wanted most parts of the website to be accessible without creating a user.
And then inviting them to the Lively community by providing special features for users; at the moment, this makes it possible to add comments, but for the future, more features could be added.

![accessability](assets/readme/screenshots/accessability.png)

## [CRUD Functionality](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#crud-functionality)

Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete their shared information on Lively. Some features make full CRUD functionality available, while others present the necessary options only.

![crud](assets/readme/screenshots/crud.png)

## [Features Showcase](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#feature-showcase)

**Header/Navigation & Footer**

Features showcase, screenshots of the features in use were taken on a laptop. All code for the navbar and footer has been added in the base.html, which was then extended into other pages.

Header & Navigation - (Profile headline only visible to Logged-In Users)

![navbar](assets/readme/screenshots/navbar.png)

![navbar](assets/readme/screenshots/navbar-profile.png)

Footer - Visible to all Users

![navbar](assets/readme/screenshots/navbar-profile.png)

In the footer, the social-media icons open in a new tab when clicked. Lively does not have any active social media currently, so the Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube links only bring the user to the home pages.

## [Home Page](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#home-page)

**Home Page**

Home Page - Visible to all Users

In the Home Page 'Hero' section, a carousel is displaying photos and links to about us, and the recipes page.

![deleteprofile](assets/readme/screenshots/profile-delete.png)

## [Admin Panel](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#admin-panel)

**Admin Panel**

Through Django's built-in Administration Panel, the Admin has full access over the data submitted to the website by registered Users. To access the Admin panel, the Admin user adds '/admin/' to the end of the URL to display [Admin](https://8000-idamariasofie-lively-ui5lancuij8.ws-eu108.gitpod.io/admin/). 
A username and password are requested. It is only the website owner that has access to admin, and she is the only superuser. In admin, you can approve comments, add, edit, and delete recipes and blog posts.

![admin](assets/readme/screenshots/admin.png)

# Future Features

[Future Features](https://github.com/idamariasofie/lively#future-features)

- **Downloadable app with quicker access to recipes, meal plans, exercise, and meditation**: I can envision Lively as an app developing it into a healthy lifestyle space and build the community.
- **Introduce weekly meal and workout plans**: This would require a paid membership, where the user will get access to weekly meal plans, workout plans, and meditation suggestions.
