## [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#overview)Overview

Lively is a healthy lifestyle blog. Users are invited to:

-  Get inspired from the daily blog posts to add healthy habits to their lives
-  Browse and filter all recipes, breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner etc. 
-  Create their own profiles
-  Like and interact with blog posts  

Lively is accessible via all browsers with full responsiveness on different screen sizes. Its aim is to create a safe, informed community of users looking to improve their lives with exercise, meditation and nutritious food.
I have created this site to meet the needs of adding healthy habits to your everyday life in an easy way. Visit the blog and get insipired by the daily posts. Or the recipe page where you can filter and browse through all of our recipes. 

In future development of this project, I hope to offer users an upgraded premium system with payment options, for weekly meal planning sent to you customized based on your profile and perforations. I also want users to be able to save and add recipes, training guides, etc to their profile. So they can access their favorites in an easy way. 

# [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#ux---user-experience)UX - User Experience

## [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#design-inspiration)Design Inspiration

I wanted Lively to have a warm yet clean aesthetic feeling to it. With colorful food photography, in combination with the clean magazine like typography and design. In this way the photos get a chance to stand out with all their beautiful colors. 

### Color Scheme

Due to the large hero sections with colorful photography throughout the website, I wanted the overall design to be clean yet elegant. 
Here is the color scheme I have worked with, simple yet has a fresh feeling to it. 

ADD IN IMAGE HERE 

### Fonts

Using  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I imported 'Baskerville' and 'Lora'. Baskerville, a classic serif font that gave the website this clean look, yet the feeling of a printed magazines which I think suited Lively. Lora has more of a modern vibe to it, which I felt worked well for the longer texts on the website. Making it easier to read, yet works well with the Baskerville headings. 

### Imagery


[](https://github.com/soukasamadi/Smoothies-blog/tree/main/assets/readme#imagery)

All the imagery have been carefully selected to go with the overall feeling of Lively and the website. All the imagery is related to the recipes and website design. The remaining imagery will be uploaded by the author to the database.

## [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#strategy-plane)Project planning

The project goal was to build a simple blog helping you to live a healthier everyday life. The 'product' was the website with a lifestyle blog, recipes, exercises and meditation guides. The recipes can then be found under the "Recipes" page in the navbar, where the user can filter these in an easy way. 
As the service itself was uncomplicated, I aimed to create an easy, uncomplicated website to navigate for the user.

Through planning and design prep work, I realised that there was an opportunity to treat this service like a 'brand'. Following common social-media design trends, I planned to use icons, high-quality, photographic images and an attractive, connected color scheme.

### [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#site-goals)Site Goals

- To provide users with a good experience when using the website.
- To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive to use and easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. 
- Easy UI for quick fulfillment of feature CRUD functionalities.
- UX remains the same, on mobile, tablet or desktop. 
- Scalable idea, with the possibility to add future additions in an easy way, and keep on developing the Lively website and business. 

## [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#agile-methodologies---project-management)Agile Methodologies - Project Management

Lively is my first project following Agile planning methods. 
As someone who loves to prepare and plan, it was a joy to get to know and use. I used my  [Github Projects Board](https://github.com/users/idamariasofie/projects/3/views/1?filterQuery=)  to plan and document all of my work. 

### [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#moscow-prioritization)MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for Lively, identifying and labelling my:

-   **Must Haves**: the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project.
    
-   **Should Haves**: the components that are valuable to the project but not 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.
    
-   **Could Haves**: these are the features that are a "add-ons" to the project, it would be nice to have them, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.
    
-   **Won't Haves**: the features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.
    

### [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#sprints)Sprints

I broke down the time available to me before project submission and pushed to have the MVP completed a month out from the submission date of 4th March 2024. 

I broke my process into Dev (Developer) Tasks, User Stories and Testing Tasks, which I converted into issues and labelled fully on my projects board. I found adding comments to my issues helpful, as I could quickly record information/sources/fixes for developing later in my README.

My Sprints are representative of a general timeframe of focus on the stated areas, with study, project work and everyday family life, some sprints timeframes blended with each other as work was completed during every available free moment.

## [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#scope-plane)Scope Plan

As this would be a dual learning/building project using several technologies that were new to me, such as Django, SQL, Bootstrap and Cloudinary, I wanted to maintain consistent control over the scope of the project, to make sure the project did not grow to more than I had time with. 
With the sheer amount of files, I needed to lockdown my project features early on into manageable blocks so as not to lose track of the MVP. 
Following Agile Planning Methodologies, I added my Developer Tasks, User Stories and Testing Tasks as issues on my  [GitHub project board](https://github.com/users/idamariasofie/projects/3/views/1), and set up Sprints to keep the flow of the project in check.

Essential features of my project were:

-   Accessible, easy to navigate website that fulfils user needs
-   Responsive website for users of mobile, tablet and desktop devices
-   User Authentication
-   User Profile creation and editing
-   Recipe page with filter function
-   User's are able to comment on post after authentication
-   Profile feature with full CRUD functionality
-   Business details to inform the user

Planning my project thoroughly from the start allowed me to identify areas of importance for MVP completion and satisfaction of assessment criteria, and to balance them with the feasibility of the features. 
Looking back at the work of the project, the planning I did in the beginning have been very helpful, even though I did not manage to implement the steady flow of updating the project board as often as I initially planned to, due to personal circumstances which lead to less time for the project. 
I see so many advantages of working and adapting to the agile way, and as my knowledge and experience grow I will keep on developing this skill.

### [](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2#wireframes)

### Wireframes
I wanted Lively to have a simple yet clean look and like a "real" website/ blog. Bootstrap classes and components were used to help control the flexibility of the site alongside overriding some classes with my own CSS to style it as I wanted to. 

The wireframes for FreeFido were created with Figma. These have stayed the same throughout the process, with a few small changes. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JzeyLcpWCQYcRLGOeUqsX5/Lively-blog?type=design&node-id=77%3A432&mode=design&t=6TRjLzrDRHXJLlbo-1) These were helpful to get in place in the start, to narrow down what I really wanted to incorporate on the website. 

**Wireframes for**

-   Home page
-   Sign Up
-   Profile

When visiting Lively and accesing the home page, I wanted it to have a feel inviting and professional. I also want the user to find the recipe/ about us and blog sections in an easy way. I knew from the start of the project I wanted to implement a carousel at the home page, to display photos in a clean way. 

Home Page Wireframes

ADD IN IMAGE x 3

This wireframe was created for the /login page/ logout page/ sign up and contact us, I wanted all of these pages to have similar design. To me it is important that the design on these pages are similar, and that it is in line with the rest of the website. Clean, aesthetic and easy to use.

### Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Lively, displaying relationships between feature components within the database

This ERD demonstrates how each feature interacts with each other and the connected PostgreSQL Database. Using Django's User Model, and Django AllAuth to carry out the user authentication. A user_id is created when the user registers with their username and email. 
This allows the user to access and edit their profile, bio, image etc and add comments, when logged in. For future development, a weekly meal plan could be added and saved recipes, that could be accessed from the profile. 

The Profile, Recipes and Comments Models were inspired by the blog walkthrough by the Code Institute and the  [Smoothies App by Soukaina Samadi](https://github.com/soukasamadi/Smoothies-blog?tab=readme-ov-file). 
They helped me to get a good and secure grasp of the templating structure and connected Python files to push my features further, adjusting them to suit my project. 

Through the Admin Django Dashboard, the connected user_id to all data entered to the site means that the Admin can remove a User and their data completely through the additon of on_delete=models.CASCADE. 
A user can delete their profile, but they can not delete the comments they have posted, this feature will come in the next version.

### Security

[](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2/tree/main/home#security)

A number of security steps were taken in this project in order to protect the user's submitted data. To meet the strict internet standards of protecting a user's data, the following processes were included in the project's development.

**AllAuth**

Django AllAuth is an installable framework that takes care of the user registration and authentication process. Authentication was needed to determine when a user was registered or unregistered and it controlled what content was accessible on Lively. The setup of AllAuth included:

-   installing it to my workspace dependencies
-   adding it to my INSTALLED_APPS in my settings.py
-   sourcing the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS from the AllAuth docs for my settings.py
-   adding its URL to my projects 'urls.py'
-   run database migrations to create the tables needed for AllAuth


**Defensive Design**

Lively was developed to ensure a good user experience, to the best of my current learning experience with Django.

-   Input validation and error messages provide feedback to the user to guide them towards the desired outcome.
-   Unregistered users are diverted to the Sign Up page from restricted access pages.
-   Authentication processes control edit/delete icons to reveal them to the content author only.
-   Deletion of profile is confirmed through an additional page, double-checking with the user.
-   Error pages are displayed with 'Home' buttons to help users get back on track.
-   Testing and validation of features completes the process.

**CSRF Tokens**

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form to help authenticate the request with the server when the form is submitted. Absence of these tokens can leave a site vulnerable to attackers who may steal a users data.

# Features

[](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2/tree/main/home#features)

## User View - Registered/Unregistered

[](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2/tree/main/home#user-view---registeredunregistered)

The idea behind Lively is to make healthy recipes accessible to all that want to live a healthier life. Therefore I wanted most part of the website to be accessible without creating a user. 
And then inviting them to the Lively community by providing special features for users, at the moment this makes it possible to add comments, but for the future more features could be added. 

ADD IMAGE ACCESSABILITY 

## CRUD Functionality

[](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2/tree/main/home#crud-functionality)

Users are able to Create, Read, Update and Delete their shared information on Lively. Some features make full CRUD functionality available, whilst others present the necessary options only.

ADD IMAGE

**Delete profile**

Delete Profile Page - Registered Users only

Will appear when the user clicked on the "Delete profile" button. The user is being asked if they are sure they want to delete their profile. 

**Admin Panel**

Through Django's built-in Administration Panel, the Admin has full access over the data submitted to the website by registered Users. To access the Admin panel the Admin user adds '/admin/' to the end of the URL to display  [Admin](https://8000-idamariasofie-lively-ui5lancuij8.ws-eu108.gitpod.io/admin/). 
A username and password is requested. It is inly the website owner, that has access to admin, and she is the only superuser. In admin you can approve comments, add, edit, and delete recipes and blog posts.
