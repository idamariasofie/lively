Each section describes the tools used, the issues found (if any), and the corresponding test results.
 

### Python Validation - PEP8

were entered into the online checker and no errors were found in any of the custom codes.

## Bugs
### Fixed Bugs

* The submit challenge did not work how it should at the first time, I couldt not add the post, it keepted reloading the page. so I fixed it by adding action ="." to the form.

* T contact form was not working at the first time. it was showing the error message everytime I tried to send an email using the contact form. so deceided to update the server and the template on my emailjs account and recreate the sendMail function. and Ta-Da it works fine now.
