# Lively Blog Testing

Back to the [README](README.md)

The testing.md file provides an overview of the testing conducted on Lively website. 
It covers code validation, accessibility, performance, testing on various devices, browser compatibility, testing user stories, and user feedback and improvements. In each section one can find the tools used, the issues found, and the corresponding test results.
 

### Python Validation - PEP8

* Python testing was done using the PEP8 Online to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. All python files
were entered into the online checker and no errors were found in any of the custom codes.

One URL was too long, while the other lines that exceeded the recommended length were automatically generated by Django.

## Bugs
### Fixed Bugs

* Bug 1: Blank Lines and Whitespace Issues in Views

Error: The views file in the Django application had multiple instances of blank line and whitespace issues, leading to linting errors. These issues violate PEP 8 guidelines, impacting code readability and style.

Fix: The fix involved adding or adjusting blank lines where needed and removing trailing whitespaces.
